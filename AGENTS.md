# AGENTS.md — `untaped-workspace`

Internals of the workspace bounded context for AI agents and contributors.
For user-facing manifest shape, registry, and command reference, see
[`docs/workspace.md`](../../docs/workspace.md). For workspace-wide rules
(4-layer DDD, Hard Rules, recipes), see the [root
`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

## Manifest + registry split

A workspace has two homes:

- **Manifest** (per-workspace, source of truth): `<workspace-dir>/untaped.yml`
  declares `name`, `defaults` (`branch`), and `repos` (list of `{url, name?,
  branch?}`). Read/written by `infrastructure.ManifestRepository`.
- **Registry** (central): a `name → path` list under `workspace.workspaces`
  in `~/.untaped/config.yml`. Just enough to power `list`, `path <name>`,
  `--name X` lookups, and tab completion. Read/written by
  `infrastructure.WorkspaceRegistryRepository`.

Method names on the registry are `entries`, `get`, `find_by_path`,
`register`, `unregister` — *not* `list`, which would shadow the `list`
builtin in nested annotations within the class.

## Workspace lookup precedence

Lookup-precedence applies only to commands that act on an existing
workspace by name or path — `add`, `remove`, `sync`, `status`,
`foreach`. For those commands:

1. Explicit `--name` → registry lookup
2. Explicit `--path` → manifest lookup
3. Otherwise: walk up from cwd looking for `untaped.yml`

Implemented in `infrastructure.WorkspaceResolver`.

Lifecycle and single-target commands (`init <name>`, `adopt <path>`,
`forget <name>`, `import <source>`, `path <name>`, `edit <name>`) take
positional arguments and skip the precedence walk. `list` and
`shell-init` operate without a workspace target.

## Git is a subprocess, not a library

`subprocess` is imported in only two places in this package, both
inside `infrastructure/`: `GitRunner` (this section) and
`system_adapters` (covered next, for shell-out / editor-launch /
`rmtree`). Domain and application layers depend on `GitRunner`'s
`Protocol`, so tests can stub it. Bare clones are cached in
`workspace.cache_dir` (default `~/.untaped/repositories`); workspace
clones use `git clone --reference` against the bare so disk + bandwidth
are shared without `git worktree` branch conflicts.

Every `subprocess.run` inside `GitRunner` carries a `timeout=` budget
so a hung remote never strands a `sync --all` sweep. The split is
**local-only vs network**, not "read-only vs write" (the local-only
bucket includes `ff_only_pull`, which does write HEAD via
`git merge --ff-only` — but executes locally with no network round
trip, so the fast budget still applies). Local-only methods
(`status`, `is_dirty`, `default_branch`, `read_remote_url`,
`read_current_branch`, `ff_only_pull`) get `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`; network
methods (`ensure_bare` clone, `bare_fetch`, `clone_with_reference`,
`fetch`) get `DEFAULT_SLOW_TIMEOUT`. Override per-instance via
`GitRunner(timeout=…, slow_timeout=…)`. The CLI surfaces
`workspace sync --timeout N`, which sets both buckets to `N` for that
invocation (so a CI script can fail fast on hung clones with a single
knob). Timeouts surface as `GitError("git <args> timed out after Ns")`,
which `SyncWorkspace._sync_repo`'s existing `GitError` handlers
translate to `skip` rows without further plumbing.

## Ports module

Every cross-use-case `Protocol` and Callable alias lives in
`application/ports.py`. Use cases declare the narrowest port they
need (`ManifestReader` vs. `ManifestRepository`, `StatusInspector`
vs. `GitInspector` vs. `GitOperations`); fatter ports extend slimmer
ones via `Protocol` inheritance, so the concrete
`ManifestRepository` / `WorkspaceRegistryRepository` / `GitRunner` /
`LocalFilesystem` / `LocalRepoDiscoverer` adapters satisfy every
variant structurally with no explicit base class.

Mirrors `untaped-awx`'s `application/ports.py`. When you add a new
shared port, put it here — never declare a private `_FooStorage`
inside a use-case file.

DTOs that cross the application/infrastructure boundary
(`DiscoveredRepo`, `DiscoveryResult`, `ManifestSource`) live in
`domain/payloads.py` as pydantic `BaseModel`s — keeps the
`infrastructure → domain` arrow clean and matches the rest of the
package's pydantic-everywhere convention.

## `system_adapters` for other side effects

Other side-effecting calls (shell-out for `foreach`, editor launch for
`edit`, `rmtree` for `remove --prune` / `sync --prune`) have their
default implementations in `infrastructure.system_adapters`:

- `shell_runner` — concrete factory satisfying `application.ports.ShellRunner`
- `editor_runner` — concrete factory satisfying `application.ports.EditorRunner`
- `LocalFilesystem` — concrete class satisfying `application.ports.Filesystem`

Application use cases require the port shapes as constructor arguments —
**none of them imports `subprocess` or `shutil` directly.** The CLI
composition root wires the defaults; tests inject stubs.

## `foreach` output semantics

Honours the standard piping contract:

- `--format table` (default): replays each repo's captured stdout / stderr
  with a `[<repo>] line` prefix once that repo's command finishes (output
  is buffered per repo by the underlying runner — chatty commands won't
  appear until they exit).
- `--format json|yaml|raw`: emits one `ForeachOutcome` row per repo
  (including `command` and `duration_s`) after every repo finishes.

Error handling has three modes: default fail-fast (break on first
non-zero exit), `--continue-on-error` (walk every repo, exit 1 if any
failed), and `--ignore-errors` (walk every repo, **exit 0** — usable
inside `set -e` scripts). On `--format table`, a `failed in: a, b, c`
summary is appended to stderr whenever at least one repo failed,
regardless of mode — failures aren't silent even when ignored. The
summary is suppressed in `--format json|yaml|raw` since each row's
`returncode` already conveys the same information.

## Branch cascade is clone-time only

Per-repo `branch` > workspace `defaults.branch` > the remote's HEAD —
honoured **only at clone time**. Subsequent `sync`s do *not* auto-switch
branches: they skip-with-warning when the on-disk branch doesn't match the
manifest's target. This stops a stale `defaults.branch` from kidnapping a
user mid-`feature/x`. State machine: `application.SyncWorkspace._sync_repo`.

## `init` vs. `adopt` vs. `forget`

Three workspace lifecycle commands with deliberately distinct shapes:

- **`workspace init <name>`** — empty workspace by name; defaults the
  on-disk location to `<workspace.workspaces_dir>/<name>` (the
  `workspaces_dir` setting is profile-overridable, default
  `~/.untaped/workspaces`). Pass `-p / --path` to override the location
  for a one-off workspace that lives elsewhere. Implementation:
  `application.InitWorkspace`.
- **`workspace adopt <path>`** — initialises a workspace from
  already-cloned repos. Each immediate subdirectory containing `.git` is
  recorded in the new manifest with its current `origin` URL and
  checked-out branch (`infrastructure.LocalRepoDiscoverer` walks the
  directory and reads both via `GitRunner.read_remote_url` /
  `read_current_branch`; a detached HEAD becomes `branch: null`;
  missing-`origin` clones surface via a stderr `warn` hook). Adopted
  clones do not share objects with the bare cache — the cascade only
  links new clones via `git clone --reference`. `<path>` stays
  positional because adopt fundamentally targets an already-populated
  directory. Implementation: `application.AdoptWorkspace`.
- **`workspace forget <name>`** — removes the workspace's registry
  entry only; the on-disk manifest and clones are preserved. Pass
  `--prune` to also `rmtree` the workspace directory; pruning is
  refused (mirroring `workspace remove --prune`) when any declared repo
  has uncommitted changes. A missing manifest or missing directory are
  tolerated — the registry entry is removed regardless. Implementation:
  `application.ForgetWorkspace` with explicit `Filesystem` +
  dirty-checker ports, wired to `LocalFilesystem` + `GitRunner` at the
  CLI composition root.

## `sync --only` strict vs. relaxed semantics

`SyncWorkspace.__call__` takes `strict_only: bool = True`. The CLI passes
`strict_only=not all_workspaces`, so:

- **Single-workspace mode** (`sync --name x --only typo`): strict. The
  use case raises `UnmatchedOnlyFilter(WorkspaceError)`, a typed
  exception carrying `unmatched: tuple[str, ...]`. Callers can `except`
  precisely without parsing the error message.
- **`--all` mode** (`sync --all --only repo-x`): relaxed. Workspaces
  whose manifests don't contain `repo-x` emit one
  `SyncOutcome(action="unmatched", repo=<identifier>, detail="not in
  this workspace's manifest")` row per requested identifier and
  continue. The discriminator lives in the type-safe `action` Literal
  (extended with `"unmatched"`) so `awk` / `cut` / `jq` consumers can
  pattern-match cleanly without overloading the `repo` data column with
  a sentinel like `<all>`.

Partial-miss is also visible: `--only repo-x,typo` against
`[repo-x, repo-y]` emits a sync row for `repo-x` AND an `unmatched`
row for `typo` — the typo doesn't get silently swallowed because a
sibling identifier matched.

## Shared test stubs

`StubGit` (satisfies the `GitRunner` port), `StubRegistry`
(satisfies `WorkspaceRegistryRepository`), and the
`empty_manifest()` helper (default-constructed
`WorkspaceManifest` for tests that only need an empty file on disk)
live in `tests/conftest.py`. Sibling unit tests import them via
`from conftest import StubGit, StubRegistry, empty_manifest` — the root
`pyproject.toml` adds this package's `tests/` dir to
`[tool.pytest.ini_options] pythonpath` so the conftest module is
runtime-importable (pytest's `--import-mode=importlib` otherwise
hides it). See the conftest docstring for the global-namespace
caveat. New shared scaffolding for this package belongs in the
same module; new shared scaffolding for *other* packages must pick
a unique module name (e.g. `_<pkg>_stubs.py`) — `conftest` is
claimed.
