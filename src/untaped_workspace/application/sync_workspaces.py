"""Use case: reconcile a sequence of workspaces against their manifests.

Wraps the singular :class:`SyncWorkspace` (per-workspace primitive) with
dispatch + ordering + a progress-notification seam. The singular still
serves ``add --sync`` / ``import --sync`` — this use case is for callers
that hold a ``Sequence[Workspace]`` (today, ``workspace sync --all``).

Parallelism is opt-in: ``parallel<=1`` or a length-1 ``workspaces``
sequence both run on the calling thread without spinning up a pool.
Above that, the body dispatches via :class:`ThreadPoolExecutor`, drains
via ``as_completed``, then re-sorts outcomes by
``(workspace_input_order, repo)`` so table/JSON output stays
predictable across runs.

The CLI clamps ``parallel`` through :func:`untaped_core.clamp_parallel`
at the surface and trusts the value here, matching how
:class:`Foreach` is wired. The session-scoped ``BareFetchTracker`` is
allocated here unless the caller supplies one — shifting the
"composition root" from the CLI module to the plural use case for a
sweep, while the singular still allows per-call trackers for the
non-sweep callers.
